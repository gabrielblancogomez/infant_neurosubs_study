## Overview
This interactive dashboard visualizes research findings on how brain activity patterns in 6-month-old infants predict language development outcomes. The project uses EEG data from 144 infants to identify distinct neural subtypes through latent profile analysis and hierarchical clustering approaches.

## Key Features
- **Interactive 3D Brain Visualizations**: Explore brain regions and connectivity patterns across three identified neural subtypes
- **Language Development Trajectories**: Visualize how early brain patterns relate to language outcomes through 36 months of age
- **Audience Adaptability**: Toggle between general and researcher views with appropriate complexity levels
- **Interactive Data Exploration**: Compare groups, explore detailed metrics, and interact with visualizations
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing

## Research Highlights
- Three distinct brain activity patterns identified in 6-month-old infants
- Early brain measures predict language development trajectories through age 3
- Left-hemisphere lateralization associated with stronger language outcomes
- Neural subtypes were independent of autism diagnosis, suggesting general developmental mechanisms

## Technical Details
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly.js and Chart.js
- Responsive design elements for cross-device compatibility
- Data processing pipeline featuring Latent Profile Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index_test.html` in a modern web browser
3. Use the sidebar navigation to explore different sections of the research
4. Toggle between general and researcher views based on your interests

## Data Source
The dashboard visualizes research data collected from 144 infants (52.8% male, 47.2% female) across research sites in London and Washington. EEG recordings and language assessments were conducted at multiple time points from 6 to 36 months of age.

## Project Structure
- `index_test.html`: Main dashboard interface
- `images/`: Contains all visualization assets and 3D brain models
- CSS styles are embedded in the HTML file for simplified distribution

## Acknowledgments
This project visualizes research on early neural and behavioral markers of language development in infancy, combining EEG analysis with longitudinal language assessments to identify meaningful developmental subtypes. This was also made with susbtanttial help of Claude Sonnet 3.7 and ChatGPT
