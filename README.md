# Infant Neurodevelopmental Subtypes Dashboard

## Overview
This interactive dashboard visualizes research findings on how brain activity patterns in 6-month-old infants predict language development outcomes. The project uses EEG data from 144 infants to identify distinct neural subtypes through latent profile analysis and hierarchical clustering approaches.

## Key Features
- **Interactive 3D Brain Visualizations**: Explore brain regions and connectivity patterns across three identified neural subtypes
- **Language Development Trajectories**: Visualize how early brain patterns relate to language outcomes through 36 months of age
- **Audience Adaptability**: Toggle between general and researcher views with appropriate complexity levels
- **Interactive Data Exploration**: Compare groups, explore detailed metrics, and interact with visualizations
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing

## Research Highlights
- Three distinct brain activity patterns identified in 6-month-old infants
- Early brain measures predict language development trajectories through age 3
- Left-hemisphere lateralization associated with stronger language outcomes
- Neural subtypes were independent of autism diagnosis, suggesting general developmental mechanisms

## Technical Details
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly.js and Chart.js
- Responsive design elements for cross-device compatibility
- Data processing pipeline featuring Latent Profile Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index_test.html` in a modern web browser
3. Use the sidebar navigation to explore different sections of the research
4. Toggle between general and researcher views based on your interests

## Data Source
The dashboard visualizes research data collected from 144 infants (52.8% male, 47.2% female) across research sites in London and Washington. EEG recordings and language assessments were conducted at multiple time points from 6 to 36 months of age.

## Project Structure
- `index_test.html`: Main dashboard interface
- `images/`: Contains all visualization assets and 3D brain models
- CSS styles are embedded in the HTML file for simplified distribution

## Acknowledgments
This project visualizes research on early neural and behavioral markers of language development in infancy, combining EEG analysis with longitudinal language assessments to identify meaningful developmental subtypes.
